Run `python scripts/audit_germany_data.py` from the repository root. The audit reads the snapshot without network access, verifies hashes and reports coverage. It does not estimate policy effects or impute missing data. Production and prices are observed official indices; the shock series are research estimates derived from financial-market observations.

The data retain the original providers' rights.
